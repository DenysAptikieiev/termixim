                  in
                  most of cases a single shipload consists of hundreds small local loads, the proper storage is vital to
                  ensure the products quality.
                  The elevators and granaries in Ukraine provide services on accumulation, storage, fumigation,
                  certification. We work with the reliable service providers only which are internationally certified
                  for
                  grain export.
                  In future we plan building our own storage premises to ensure the highest quality standard of our

            meat,
            oil and fertilizers, sugar and flour etc. Ukrainian fertile soils are among the best in the world.
            Ukraine now struggles to adjust its agricultural business to the international needs and to produce the
            products
            of the high quality. Meanwhile, Ukrainian grain, legumes, oil-bearing crops and fertilizers have already won

                <p>
                  Legumes (Fabaceae ) are used both as food grain seed and livestock forage and silage.
                  Legumes is the only vegetable culture which has a valuable vegetable protein which can substitute an
                  animal protein. Legumes are rich in vitamins and microelements such as folate, manganese, thiamin,
                  magnesium, iron. That is why legumes are largely used in vegetarian diet.
                  Ukrainian legumes are represented by beans, soybeans, peas, lentils, lupins etc. Ukrainian legumes
                  market
                  is yet to develop and increase, since Ukrainian cuisine does not consume much legumes

                <p>
                  Ukraine is one of the leading world’s exports of oil-bearing crops and their products. They include
                  sunflower seeds which are a symbol of Ukraine, rapeseed, linaceae, corn, cannabaceae etc. The
                  vegetable
                  oil is healthy and full of essential elements and vitamins.
                  Oil-bearing crops contain a triglyceride which is extracted from a plant as an oil. Vegetable oils are
                  used by humans for centuries for food and fuel. Vegetable oil adds to culinary dishes its rich flavor.
                  Vegetable oils are widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries (soaps, candles, skin
                  products,
                  perfumes, ointments etc.) In mechanics vegetable oil is a part of lubricants.
                  Vegetable oil is an irreplaceable ingredient of pet food. It is also is used a fuel since ancient
                  times

                <p>
                  Grain is the most important vegetable plant in human history. In ancient times good grain harvest used
                  to
                  mean prosperity and happiness, while bad harvest of grains symbolized poverty and death.
                  Ukraine is famous worldwide for its grain. Ukraine’s fertile soils, favorable climate conditions and
                  cheap
                  grain costs lead this country to the leaders of the world grain market. It is certain, that Ukraine
                  does
                  not use its full grain potential, so the harvest figures could be doubled in future in case of the
                  improved management.
                  Ukrainian grain is represented by wheat, rye, barley, millet, oats, buckwheat and others.
                  The main problem of grain production in Ukraine is grain storage. Building new granaries and new
                  transshipment complexes are among our primary plans

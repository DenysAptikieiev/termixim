              One of our main concerns is storage organizing for the agricultural products sold for export. Because in
              most of cases a single shipload consists of hundreds small local loads, the proper storage is vital to
              ensure the products quality.
              The elevators and granaries in Ukraine provide services on accumulation, storage, fumigation,
              certification. We work with the reliable service providers only which are internationally certified for
              grain export.
              In future we plan building our own storage premises to ensure the highest quality standard of our crops at
              the attractive storage cost
